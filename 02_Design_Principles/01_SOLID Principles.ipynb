However, if the baker is also responsible for managing the inventory, ordering supplies, serving customers, and cleaning the bakery, this would violate the SRP. Each of these tasks represents a separate responsibility, and by combining them, the baker's focus and effectiveness in baking bread could be compromised."

    "- The BasicPrinter class is forced to implement methods for scanning and faxing, which it cannot support. This violates the Interface Segregation Principle because the class is burdened with irrelevant methods, leading to unnecessary complexity and potential runtime errors. When a class is required to implement methods that it does not need, it results in bloated interface, making the class more difficult to understand and maintain. Additionally, the presence of unsupported methods can lead to runtime exceptions, as seen with UnsupportedOperationException throw by scan() and fax() methods in the BasicPrinter class.\n",
    "- This design flaw also makes the code less flexible and harder to extend. If new functionalites are added to the Machine interface, all implementing classes, including those that do not require the new functionalities, must be updated. This creates unnecessary dependencies and increases the risk of introducing bugs. By forcing classes to implement irrelevant methods, the code becomes tightly coupled, reducing its modularity and reusability. Adhering to the interface Segregation Principle by creating smaller, more focues interfaces ensures that classes only implement the methods they need, leading to a more robust and maintainable system.\n",
