    "# Parking Lot System\n",
    "- A parking lot management system is designed to handle the operations of parking vehicles, collecting payments, and managing available space efficiently. The system should be able to accomodate different types of vehicles, provide payment options, and ensure a smooth user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules of the System\n",
    "- Setup\n",
    "    - The parking lot has multiple slots available for parking\n",
    "    - Different types of vehciles (bike, car, truck) can occupy different slot size.\n",
    "    - Each vechile is issued a parking ticket upon entry\n",
    "    - The system calculates the parking fee based on the duration of stay and vehcile type.\n",
    "- Exit and payment\n",
    "    - A vechile needs to make a payment before exiting\n",
    "    - Multiple payment methods (Cash, Card, UPI) should be supported.\n",
    "    - Once payment is sucessful, the vehicle is allowed to exit, and the parking slot is freed.\n",
    "- Illegal Actions\n",
    "    - A vehicle cannot park in an already occupied slot\n",
    "    - Vehicles cannot vacate without completing the payment processs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interview Setting\n",
    "### Point 1: Intro and Vague problem statement\n",
    "- Interviwer: Let's start with a basic problem statement. Design a Parking Lot System\n",
    "- Candidate: Here's my understanding of the Parking Lot system\n",
    "    - The system will manage diffeerent types of vehicles\n",
    "    - vehicles will enter and exit after making a payment.\n",
    "    - Payment must be completed before leaving\n",
    "    - The system should handle different vehciesl sizes and slot allocations efficiently.\n",
    "- Interviewer: Yes, we are alinged with the flow.\n",
    "- Candidate: Before diving into the design, I'd like to clarify a few requirements:\n",
    "    - Will we have mulitple types of parking slots based on vehicle size?\n",
    "    - Are we supporting multiple payment methods?\n",
    "    - Should the system track the duration of each parked vehcile?\n",
    "    - Can there be multiple floors parking lots?\n",
    "### Point 2: Clarify Requirements\"\n",
    "- Interviewer: We want a system that:\n",
    "    - Supports different vehicle types (Bike, Car, Truck)\n",
    "    - Has different slot sizes based on vehicle type\n",
    "    - Allows multiple payment methods\n",
    "    - ensures smooth entry and exit with parking fee calculation.\n",
    "- Candidate: To summarize, the key requirements are:\n",
    "    - A parking lot with multiple slot types\n",
    "    - Support for bikes, cars, and trucks\n",
    "    - Dynamic slot allocation based on vehicle size\n",
    "    - Payment processing with multiple methods\n",
    "    - Entry ticket issuance and exit valdiation.\n",
    "- Interviewer: Perfect, let's proceed.\n",
    "### Point 3: Identify key components:\n",
    "- Candidate: Now that we have the requirements, let's identify the key components of our Parking Lot system:\n",
    "    1. Vehicle: Represents different types of vehicles\n",
    "    2. Parking Slot: Represents an individual space - Bike, Car, Truck\n",
    "    3. Parking Lot: Manages parking slot and vehicle allocations\n",
    "    4. Payment System: Hanldes different payment methods like Credit Card, Cash, UPI, etc"

    "### Point 4: Design Challenges\n",
    "- Interviewer: What design challenges do we anticipate?\n",
    "- Candidate: The key challenges for the Parking Lot system include:\n",
    "    1. Efficeint Slot Allocation: Ensuring vehicles are assigned to the correct slot type.\n",
    "    2. Tracking Vehicle Duration: Keeping a record of entry times for payment calculations.\n",
    "    3. Handling Payments: Supporting multiple payment methods dynamically.\n",
    "    4. Managing Concurrency: Ensuring simultaneous vehicle entries and exits are handled properly.\n",
    "### Point 5: Approach:\n",
    "- Interviewer: How would you approach these challenges?\n",
    "- Candidate: I propose using design patterns effectively. Here are my strategies:\n",
    "    1. Factory for Vehicle Creation:\n",
    "        - Allows easy extension for new vehicle types.\n",
    "        - Ensures consistent object creatioon.\n",
    "    2. Strategy Pattern for Payment and Parking Fares.\n",
    "        - Enables flexible payment methods and Parking fares based on the vehicle type and duration for parking.\n",
    "        - Easily extendable for future payment integrations and new fare strategy additions.\n",
    "    3. Singleton Pattern for Parking Lot Management:\n",
    "        - Ensures only one instance of the parking lot exists.\n",
    "    4. Observer Pattern for Exit Notifications:\n",
    "        - Notifies the system when a vehicle exits\n",
    "        - Can be extended for alerts or logging\n",
    "### Point 6: Implementation\n",
    "- Interviewer: Ready to discuss implementation?\n",
    "- Candidate: Yes. I'll focus on a modualr and scalable deisgn that meets the core parking lot requirements.\n",

    "- Interviwer: What makes your approach effective?\n",
    "- Candidate: Here are the key strenghts of my approach:\n",
    "    - Scalability: This design allows easy expansion to accommodate more vehicle types, parking spot categoires, and payment methods.\n",
    "    - Modularity: Each components, such as vechile creation, parking management, and payment processing is handled separately ensuring a clean and maintainable structure.\n",
    "    - Flexbiblity: The use of design patterns like Factory and strategy allows seamless modifications and enchancements without affecting exisiting code.\n",
    "    - Clarity: The architecture is intuitive, making it easy for developers to understand, implement, and extend when needed.\n",

    "##### Extensibility:\n",
    "1. Implementing Multi-Floor Parking lot:\n",
    "    - Currently our Parking Lot implementation is based on a single floor. However, if an interviewer asks how we would extend our solution to accomonadate a multi-floor parking lot.\n",
    "    - To extend the solution for a multi-floor parking Lot, we create a concrete ParkingFloor class and encapsulate the logic of handling parking spots withing this class. The ParkingLot class would then be responsible for managing multiple parking floors, while each floor would handle its own parking spots. This apporach adheres to the Sigle Responsibility Principle, ensuring that each class has a clear and distinct responsibility."
